Project initialization

install firebase tools :
`npm install -g firebase-tools`


 It's a good practice to frequently update both the Firebase CLI and the SDK with these commands inside the functions folder of your Firebase project

 `npm install firebase-functions@latest firebase-admin@latest --save`

 `npm install -g firebase-tools`

 Run firebase login to log in via the browser and authenticate the Firebase CLI.

 Go to your Firebase project directory.
